The lightest element is hydrogen. Hydrogen is the lightest element with an atomic mass of 1.000794 u (unified atomic mass units), making it the lightest element on the periodic table. everybody knows that hydrogen is the lightest element, but I think you are asking a question that is not meaningful in the context of the periodic table.

The periodic table is a table of elements, and each element is represented by a symbol, atomic number, and atomic mass. The elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number, and the lightest element is hydrogen, with an atomic number of 1 and an atomic mass of 1.000794 u.

So, to answer your question, the lightest element is hydrogen. The other elements in the periodic table are listed in order of increasing atomic number, and they are:

1. Hydrogen (H) - atomic number 1, atomic mass 1.00794 u
2. Helium (He) - atomic number 2, atomic mass 4.0026 u
3. Lithium (Li) - atomic number
